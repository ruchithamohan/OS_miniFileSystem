A file system is a crucial component of any operating system, responsible for managing how data is stored, organized, and accessed on storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash drives. It provides an abstraction layer between the physical storage media and the higher-level software applications.

Key components of a file system include:

1.File System API: An Application Programming Interface (API) defines the interface through which applications interact with the file system. It provides a set of functions or methods for creating, reading, writing, and deleting files, as well as for managing directories and metadata associated with files.

2.Superblock: The superblock is a critical data structure at the beginning of a file system that contains metadata about the file system itself. This metadata includes details such as the total size of the file system, the number of blocks or sectors it occupies, the size of each block, the number of inodes, and pointers to other important data structures within the file system.

3.Inode: Short for "index node," an inode is a data structure that represents a file or directory in the file system. Each inode stores metadata about a specific file or directory, including its permissions, ownership, timestamps (creation, modification, access), size, and pointers to the data blocks that store the actual content of the file or directory.

4.Data Block Management: Data blocks are the fundamental units of storage within a file system. They are used to store the actual contents of files and directories. Data block management involves allocating and deallocating data blocks efficiently to store file data while minimizing fragmentation and optimizing performance.

The file system API serves as the interface through which applications interact with the file system, allowing them to perform operations such as creating, reading, writing, and deleting files. The superblock provides essential metadata about the file system, while inodes represent individual files and directories, storing their metadata and pointers to data blocks. Data block management ensures efficient allocation and utilization of storage space within the file system.

Implementing a file system involves designing and implementing algorithms and data structures to manage these components effectively, ensuring reliable storage and efficient access to data. Different file systems, such as FAT, NTFS, ext4, and ZFS, employ various techniques and optimizations tailored to specific use cases and requirements.

The list of commands we are executing in our file system is:
 Listing files under a given directory
 Changing directories
 Copying files to directories
 Removing files
 Removing directories
 Creating files
 Creating directories
 Renaming files
 Renaming directories
 Reading files
 Printing the current directory path
 Writing contents to the files
 Finding a specific file or directory.
